# CS-300-DSA-Analysis-and-Design

   - What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In the projects for this course, the goal was to create a program that would load a course catalogue, which would allow advisors to see classes available as well as the prerequisites for them. This is intended to assist with planning out courses with students to acheive the best plan to complete their degree.


   - How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

To create the application, I first looked at how the data structure would be used in the program. Seeing that the goal was to load a course catalogue, I created a method to load the info from the CSV file holding the input that would then split each line into tokens to display in the menu. 


   - How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Any issues that came forward prompted me to read back through given materials for the course. Using my zyBooks to refresh and see step-by-step how structures worked helped with any impedements. 


   - How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

What I have learned from this project has helped in getting a better grasp on how CPP and CSV files interact. As well as learning the methods necessary for inputting lists of tokens. This is a good start to learning how databases are structured and how data can be pulled from them. 


   - How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Knowing the need for having programs that are able to be altered and readable, it drives home the point of industry standards. Being sure to use apparopriate whitespace helped immensely in keeping the methods separate. This helped in letting me look over the code and make sure it was appropriately formatted.
